## Step-by-Step Guide to Ignoring Jupyter Notebook Outputs using Git Attributes

**1. Create a `.gitattributes` file:**

- Open your Jupyter Notebook directory (folder containing your notebooks) in a file explorer or terminal.
- Create a new text file named `.gitattributes` (make sure the filename starts with a dot).

**2. Add the filtering rule:**

- Open the `.gitattributes` file in a text editor.
- Paste the following line into the file:

```
*.ipynb filter=strip-notebook-output
```

**3. Configure Git filters (one-time setup):**

- Open a terminal or command prompt in your Jupyter Notebook directory.
- Run the following commands one by one:


git config --global filter.strip-notebook-output.clean "jupyter nbconvert --ClearOutputPreprocessor.enabled=True --ClearMetadataPreprocessor.enabled=True --to=notebook --stdin --stdout --log-level=ERROR"
git config --global filter.strip-notebook-output.smudge "cat"


**Explanation:**

- The first command tells Git to use `jupyter nbconvert` to strip outputs and metadata when committing `.ipynb` files.
- The second command tells Git to simply display the original content without modifications when viewing your notebooks locally.

**4. Commit your changes:**

- Make any changes to your Jupyter Notebooks as usual.
- When you commit your changes, Git will automatically remove the outputs and metadata before adding them to the repository.

**Important notes:**

- This configuration only affects how Git handles your notebooks on your local machine. Other users who clone your repository will still need to have `jupyter nbconvert` installed to view the notebooks without outputs.
- Ensure you have `jupyter` and `nbconvert` installed before proceeding. You can install them using `pip install jupyter nbconvert`.

**Alternative approach:**

- If you prefer not to install `jupyter nbconvert`, you can remove the `"jupyter nbconvert"` part from the first command in step 3. However, Git will then discard any outputs and metadata permanently without the ability to view them locally.

**Additional tips:**

- You can test the configuration by adding a temporary cell output, committing your changes, and checking if the output is removed.
- If you encounter any issues, double-check the file paths and commands for accuracy.
